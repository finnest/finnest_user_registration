There is bootstrap for CSS, but I'm not interested in the front end...functionally on the back end it works.
EJS is simply a templating language...if it's looking funny on sublime. Go to "view" --> "syntax" --> "html"

Instructions
1) Install packages: "npm install"
2) Download MySQL - I recommend doing that via https://brew.sh/ and then type "brew update" and "brew install mysql"
2.5) make sure to run MySQL as a DAEMON
3) Launch "node server.js"
4) go to "http://localhost:8080"
